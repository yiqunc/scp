School catchment has significant impacts on many urban planning and socio-economic aspects such as social infrastructure accessibility, livabil-ity, community health and wellbeing, and housing affordability. It is a challenging task for governments to strategically plan school catchments with a vision that not only supports the current school capacities and en-rolment demands, but also stays aligned with future population growth trends and education investment strategies. Inspired by the Enrolment Simulation Application (ESA) created by SGS Economics and Planning, this work investigates and implements two solutions (greedy algorithm and integer linear programming) for this problem, then compares and dis-cusses their performance over various planning scenarios.
